# Captioning Exercise

This exercise introduces you to the process of adding captions or subtitles to a video.  


## Using YouTube to Create Subtitles/Captions
We're going to use YouTube's built-in tools to help with captioning of videos. 

1. Log into YouTube and select "Creator Studio (Beta)" from the drop-down menu under your photo in the top right corner. Because the beta version does not yet allow editing of captions, you'll need to select the "Creator Studio Classic" link in the bottom left corner of the screen. (If you're prompted to ask why you're switching to classic, you can tell them it's missing the captioning feature.)

3. Click the arrow in the Edit menu next to your video, and choose "Subtitles or CC". (You may be prompted to specify a language). When the "Manage subtitles and closed captions" screen appears, click the large "Add new subtitles or CC" button and choose either English or English (United States) as the language.

4. You'll be prompted for a captioning method. 
 - "Upload a file" allows you to upload a transcript or timed subtitle file. (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en). If it's a timed subtitle file, all you'll need to do is check to make sure that everything is synced properly.  
 - "Transcribe and Auto-Sync" allows you to either paste in your script, or transcribe the audio of the video real-time. You'll then need to adjust the timings so that the captions are synced with the slides.  
 - "Create New Subitles or CC" allows you to type in subtitles/captions one at a time, at the location in the video that you want them to appear.  

 5. Choose the approach you'd like to use, and caption your video.   

 7. When you're done, preview the video to see how it looks. Make any necessary edits or additions.

 8. When you're satisfied with your captions, click on the "Publish" button. 


## Deliverable
Once you're done, select "Info & Settings" from the links on the top of the screen. Make sure that your video is set to either Unlisted or Public--not Secret. Copy the Video URL shown on the right side of the screen, and post it to the week 11 myCourses Assignment.

This should be completed by noon on Sunday, November 10th.
