# Digital Audio Exercise

This exercise introduces you to basic digital audio production. You will be using Audacity, an open source audio editor, to create a soundtrack for a PowerPoint presentation. This will require you to learn the basic skills needed to record, edit, mix and integrate a voiceover track. 

You will need to produce an ~80 second soundtrack, in mp3 format, that can be added to a five-slide PowerPoint presentation--16 seconds of narration for each of 5 slides.  While the slides each display for only 15 seconds, there is a 1 second transition between each slide. 

The soundtrack for your slides will consist primarily of a narration that syncs with the slides as they auto-advance.  If you want, you can add other sounds to the soundtrack, such as Foley art (sound effects), ambient sound, or background music.

## One Sound File or Many?

There are two main approaches to producing the soundtrack for the first five slides: 

1. Produce the whole thing as a single audio file for 5 slides that will be about 1 minute and 15 seconds long (actually about 1 minute and 19 seconds - see below), or
2.	produce five separate sound files, each of which is 15 seconds or less in length.

There are pros and cons for each approach, described below. 

Entire soundtrack in one audio file:
* Advantages:  Results in smoother transitions and more consistent sound levels. Can easily add background music or sound. 
* Disadvantages:  Timing between soundtrack and slides can easily slip as the presentation proceeds; you'll need to check this and may need to record the entire narration several times to get it right. Although the timing for each slide is 15 seconds, transitions add about 1 second per slide, so your narration will need to reflect that. (The best way to avoid that is to record the narration while watching the presentation auto-advance.)

Separate audio files for each slide:
* Advantages:  Syncing audio to the slides will be easier and more reliable.
* Disadvantages:  Narration may be choppy.  Difficult to maintain a consistent background sound and audio levels that span multiple slides. 
* Note: You will need to make adjustments for playback if a slide contains both audio and animation (more on this later).


## Preparing to Record

- Downloading Sample Ignites
  - Download and decompress the [archive of sample presentations](sample-ignites.zip).  
  - Each presentation has 6 slides: An intro/title slide, 4 presentation slides, and a credits slide at the end. 
  - Choose the set of slides you want to work with.  You can choose from Chocolate, Dr. Who, Star Wars or Nintendo. Don't worry too much about the content of the narration--this is about process rather than content, so your narration content doesn't have to be accurate! 
  - You will need to record narration for the title slide and the four content slides; you do not need to record narration for the credits slide (unless you want to).
- Script Writing:  
  - Write a script to be read based on your notes so you'll know what to say.  Time yourself reading it to make sure your script fits the time constraints (15 seconds per slide). Trim as needed. Narration is hard to do extemporaneously - it is much easier to read from a script.
- Preparing Background Sounds [optional]:
  - Prepare any background sounds by downloading sound files you want to import into your narration.  If you want to create sounds with the Audacity generators, play around with them first.  Determine what parameter settings give you the sounds you want. A second track that is music which you can fade in and out as background can be nice.

## Setup PowerPoint and Audacity:

1. Set up your PowerPoint slides to play the slideshow in a window rather than full-screen.  Click on the "Slide Show" tab, then the "Set Up Slide Show" icon.  Choose "Browsed by an individual (window)" as the Show type.
2. Maneuver both PowerPoint and Audacity so that you can simultaneously see both windows. 
3. Make sure you have the first slide in your presentation selected.

## Recording

1. In Audacity, click the red "Record" button in the Transport toolbar to begin recording.
2. In PowerPoint, immediately click the "Play Slideshow" button to begin your presentation, and begin narrating. 
3. If you're recording a continuous narration, when the credits slide appears in PowerPoint, click the "Stop" button in the Transport toolbar. 
4. If you're recording separate narrations for each slide, click the "Stop" button after the first slide, and then repeat steps 1 and 2, starting the slide show each time from the slide you want to narrate. 
5. Trim the recording to fit the appropriate time limit if needed--you may need to cut out any dead space at the beginning or end. Select the areas you want to trim by highlighting and hitting Ctrl-X or just the  Delete key.
6. Save the Audacity project as a backup for the original recording. 
7. Once your narration file is the proper length, you can re-record sections that did not work well the first time, import new sounds, mix and apply effects, and generally mess with stuff until you like your soundtrack. 
8. If you re-record part of your narration, you'll notice that any new narration ends up in a brand new track.  
  - This is good - you can now use the "Time Shift" tool to move it around and line the new recording up with the original recording. 
  - At that point you can fade out the original track, fade in the new track, fade out the new track when it's done, and fade in the original track at that point to resume your original narration.
  - If you import a new sound file (for example, a sound effect), it should also end up in a new track.  You can move it around and fade it in and out.
9. Play with adjusting levels and making transitions (with fades or envelopes)
  - Use the "Amplify" effect to change level for an entire track (or use the level slider for the track)
  - Use "Fade In" and "Fade Out" to smooth transitions and do cross fades
  - Use the "Envelope Tool" to draw a more complex envelope curve over a track for more control

## Adding Effects (optional)
If you'd like, you can apply some effects to your audio track.  There are many to choose from. If you try an effect and don't like it, you can use Undo to roll back to the previous version.

- Effects Compressor allows you to compress dynamic range.  This makes loudness the same throughout the track, something that's particularly helpful if you recorded each of the slide narrations separately, or went back and redid part of the narration. 
- Effects Equalization can be used to improve how the soundtrack sounds on poor-quality speakers. Choose the "AM radio curve".
- There are several Reverbs to choose from - try the "Reverb", if it's present (more effects are typically available than displayed - choose "manage" under the effects menu to enable/disable effects).
- Try some other effects that sound interesting and see what happens.  Don't forget you can undo anything that you hate!

## Saving Your Audio as MP3

1. Use File-->Save Project As to save the project file with all the tracks split out so that you can remix later if you need to.
2. Use  File-->Export Audio (or "Export Audio Selection" if you selected only a portion of the audio file window) to export the final mix as an mp3. You'll get a warning that the tracks will be mixed down to two stereo tracks, and then will get an option to add MP3 tags to the file. 

## Adding the Audio Files to the PowerPoint

Follow these steps if you have a single file that spans all four slides:
1. Go back to PowerPoint and select the first slide where you want sound to begin (which is not necessarily the first slide (in your final project it will be the second slide after the title slide).
2. From the Insert menu, select Insert Media-->Audio-->Audio from my PC... and select your mp3 file (on a Mac it's "Insert-->Audio-->Audio from File..." )
3. An audio icon will appear in the middle of the slide; move it to the lower right corner.  
4. When the audio icon is selected, an "Audio Tools" tab will appear at the top of the window, with a section to set Playback options. 
5. In the "Playback tab" of the audio tools section choose the Start menu and select "Play Automatically" and check the option to "Play Across Slides" 
6. Select "Hide Icon During Show" option so you don't see the sound icon during playback.
7. Select the Animations tab in the ribbon, and make sure you still have the audio icon selected.
8. Under the Timing menu, set Start to "With Previous"
9. Click the "Play Slideshow" button to run your slides, hopefully hearing your soundtrack!

If you have multiple files, one for each slide, you'll attach the appropriate audio file to each slide.  The settings for each file/slide will be the same as above except: 
- In the Audio Format tab, set the Start option to "Automatically" but do not select "Play Across Slides".
- Select the Animations tab and make sure the Animations tab is displayed. Also, make sure the Animations pane is displayed. 
- Even though the sound you added to a slide is not an animation, you will see two animations listed, the oval that moves across the slide as an elapsed time indicator and your mp3 sound file.  Select the mp3 file (it should be second since you added it later) and make sure Start is set to "With Previous." This makes sure that the sound plays at the same time as the animation (otherwise, it will play after the animation).
- Note: That final step is only necessary because the transitions between slides are considered animations. If you do not include transitions or animations in your final project for the class, you will not need to worry about this step in your project narration.

## Deliverable
In PowerPoint, use "Save As" to save your narrated presentation as an MPEG-4 (*.mp4) file. (Make sure you play the resulting .mp4 file to be sure the audio is working properly before continuing!) 

Log into YouTube and upload the .mp4 file to your account. Set the visibility to unlisted or public (not secret), so that we'll be able to grade it. ([YouTube video uploading instructions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))
