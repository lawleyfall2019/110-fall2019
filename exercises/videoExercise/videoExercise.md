# Digital Video Editing Exercise

Using Photoshop's digital video editing capabilities (which were covered in this week's readings), make a short trailer for a game of your choice (real or imagined). It can be a digital game or a board game. You should make use of existing audio and video assets that you are able to find on the Web so that the focus is on assembling a video and the use of the editing tools and final compression, and not on capturing video and audio.  

*Note: If you already have experience editing video, and would prefer to use a different video editing tool (e.g. Premiere or Avid's digital video suite), you are free to use that as long as you fulfill the basic requirements of the exercise.*


Your video must meet the following requirements:
1.	Begin with a title screen (text on a background or text over an image/video clip).
2.	Include at least one audio track (music or narration).  
3.	Incorporate a minimum of four motion video clips and/or still images in the video track. At least one of the clips must be a still image. 
4.	Animate at least one still image using panning, zooming or a combination of the two, i.e, the "Ken Burns effect," as discussed in class.  
5.	Use transitions between clips (simple cross fades are fine).
6.	End with a closing credits screen that shows your name as well as credits for any assets used in the video.
7.	Have a total length of at least 30 seconds and no more than 60 seconds.

There are a variety of sources of Creative Commons licensed images, which you can find by doing a Google Image search and then using the "Tools" menu to limit the usage rights to things that are labeled for reuse. 

Here are some sources for free, downloadable videos you can also use in your work:
- [Pexels](https://videos.pexels.com/video-license)
- [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies)

When you've completed your video editing, use "Export -> Render Video" to save the video using the H.264 codec. (I *strongly* suggest saving your work before you do this; on some of the lab computers, the rendering has caused memory errors that result in Photoshop freezing.)

Use the HDTV preset (1280x720) at high quality. Upload your completed video file to YouTube. If you used copyrighted materials, or would prefer that the video not be visible to others, you can upload it as an "unlisted" video--**not** as a "private" video, because then we can't grade it. (Once you've received your grade for the assignment, you are welcome to delete the video if you'd like.)

# Submitting Your Work
Post the URL to your completed video to the myCourses dropbox. (The dropbox requires a file submission, because we messed up. :) Upload a text file with the URL, but add the URL in the description, too!)

If you choose to work on this on your own rather than coming to class on Thursday, you must submit the URL by the beginning of Thursday's class. If you come to class on Thursday, you must submit the URL by noon on Sunday, November 24.
