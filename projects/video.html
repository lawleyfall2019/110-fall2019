            <div class="page-desc">
                <p>This assignment is intended to provide some closure and perspective on the overall content for this course. I believe this is more effective in helping you review and understand the material for the course than a traditional final exam.</p>

                <p>You will create a video with 20 distinct 15-second segments--at least one for  each week of the semester. The video should have audio narration as well as captioning. You can start with a PowerPoint presentation, using the process from the week 11 exercises, or you can create the video from scratch using the tools of your choice.</p>

                <p>Fifteen weeks of class means fifteen segments of content; the remaining fove segments can be used however you'd like. You could include introductory or closing material, add additional segments for a specific week to illustrate a concept, or include your thoughts on the course as a whole.</p>

                <h2>The Ignite Format</h2>
                <i class="fas fa-angle-left" aria-label="expand/collapse arrow"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The highly-constrained Ignite format (20 slides, each displayed for only 15 seconds) forces presenters to focus their message and practice their delivery. It also lends itself best to clear and effective visuals rather than dense slides filled with bulleted text. </p>

                <p>I have provided a <a href="IgniteTemplate.pptx">PowerPoint template for your presentation</a>. In the template, there is an 15-second countdown animation at the bottom of each content slide; it's there to provide you with a visual cue on how much time you have to narrate each slide. You can leave that in, or remove it; it's your choice. There are 21 slides in the template; the first one is simply the title slide--it does not need narration or captions. The next 20 slides each auto-advance after displaying for 15 seconds. You're welcome to change the design and layout of the slides, but be aware that if you try to convert the template for use in another program (OpenOffice, Google Slides, Keynote, etc), it is likely to create problems with the slide timings and/or the embedded narrations, and I will not be able to provide any assistance to you on solving problems in those formats.</p>

                <p>You are not *required* to use PowerPoint for this; you can use other video editing tools if you prefer. However, regardless of the tools you use, you still need to ensure that it's broken up into 20 discrete sections, with at least one for each of the 15 weeks of the semester.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Your individual segments should focus on images and storytelling, not blocks of text or bullet points. The connection to a given week's content should be clear, and you should use images (or animations, or video clips) relevant to the concept. On-screen text (other than captions) should be minimal, and the visual design and typography should be consistent and work well with your overall presentation. The best videos also have a unifying narrative that pulls them together. Here's a particularly engaging example from 2018:</p>

                <p>On December 17, from 1:30-4pm in GOL 2435, we will have a "viewing party" to watch some of the best submissions. This is during the NMID section's exam time, but is open to both sections. We'll provide popcorn and soda, too! Attendance is encouraged but not required. If you can't make it because you've already left town, or you have a conflict, that's okay, too.</p>

                <p>The total assignment is worth 80 points, and counts as 20% of your final grade.</p>
                <p>The segments for each of the 15 weeks are worth 5 points each, with one point for each of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearly related to a specific week's material</li>
                        <li>Relevant and accurate content</li>
                        <li>Good audio quality</li>
                        <li>Accurate captioning</li>
                        <li>Design and typography</li> 
                    </ul>
                <p>The last five points will be based on the extent to which you create a coherent, consistent, engaging narrative.</p>
